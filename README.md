# Pok√©Speare Frontend

## Getting started

See the available scripts below.

## Notes

- All the business logic is tested using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
- I created the components using [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
- I used [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) to achieve [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control), this simplified testing and help to build decoupled classes.
- I used only functional components. To manage the state I used [hooks](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
- In `.env` you can change the backend URL.
- This repo has Continuous Deployment enabled. Every push on master goes straight to [https://pokespeare.mattianatali.dev/](https://pokespeare.mattianatali.dev/). I used [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to do that.
- If you want to see the full picture, please see the [docker compose repository](https://github.com/matitalatina/pokespeare-docker).

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
